        <p>
          My name is <span class="highlight">Douglas</span>, I'm 23 years old,
          and I'm trying to be a
          <span class="highlight">FullStack developer</span>. I started in the
          tech world in 2019. My first professional experience was with quality
          assurance, but sometimes I wanted to code. Then, in 2021, I started as
          a Delphi developer. In this experience, I learned more about team
          code, databases, and some code skills. But, despite the fact that I
          was coding, I didn't like the way things were going. I felt frozen in
          time. In 2022, I had the opportunity to be a JavaScript/TypeScript
          developer with modern tools. So, since then, I've been working on
          this.
